# British-English Words

Filename:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**en-GB-words**<br> 
Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A collection of British-English words.<br>


## Introduction
It is almost impossible to find a purely British-English dictionary or word 
list. By default, Oxford and Cambridge include US/CAD/AUS English variants and 
references in their published dictionaries and on their websites. Further, what 
is often labelled as 'en-GB' is almost always, in fact, International English.


## Editorial Policy
The original word list contained over 150,000 entries, compiled from various 
public domain sources. Entries that do not conform to the preferred standard of 
British-English spelling are removed.

The list continues to be improved:
* Missing entries are discovered and added;
* Ongoing reviews flag undesirable words which are removed.
An update is generally issued when several hundred entries have been added 
since the previous one.

The vocabulary sources include:
* Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (8th Edition)
* Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary (3rd Edition)
* Collins English Dictionary (collinsdictionary.com)
* Oxford Learner's Dictionaries (oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com)
* Cambridge Dictionary (dictionary.cambridge.org)

In addition to the above, various online sources and publications are regularly 
sampled to keep the list relevant and up-to-date.


### Inclusion Rules
This list contains words conforming to the preferred standard of 
British-English spelling.

* **-ise** is preferred over **-ize**, **-sation** over **-zation**, etc.
* US-English spelling is not allowed (e.g. **color**, **odor**, etc.)
* Some (few) universally-recognised words are allowed and included:
    * Words like **movie**, **bike**, **soccer**, **vacation**, et al.
* Common proper names are included; not just common British / English names but 
also common names from around the world.
* A limited number of hyphenated words are present but only where the 
individual words are not already included.


### Standard
The file **en-GB-words** is a plain-text UTF-8 file and is the basis of [this 
Hunspell language file 
dictionary](https://github.com/darmeth/en-GB-dictionary).
