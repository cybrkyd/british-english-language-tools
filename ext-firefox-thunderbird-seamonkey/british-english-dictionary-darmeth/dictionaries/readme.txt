Introduction
-------------

It is almost impossible to find a purely British-English dictionary or word 
list. By default, Oxford and Cambridge include US/CAD/AUS English variants and 
references in their published dictionaries and on their websites. Further, what 
is often labelled as 'en-GB' is almost always, in fact, International English.

This dictionary aims to include only those words conforming to the preferred 
standard of British-English spelling.

-----------------
Editorial Policy
-----------------

The original base word list and dictionary contained over 150,000 entries, 
compiled from various public domain sources. Entries that do not conform to the 
preferred standard of British-English spelling are removed.

The base word list and dictionary continues to be improved:

    -- Missing entries are discovered and added;
    -- Ongoing reviews flag undesirable words which are removed. An update is 
       generally issued when several hundred entries have been added since the 
       previous one.

The vocabulary sources include:

    -- Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (8th Edition)
    -- Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary (3rd Edition)
    -- Collins English Dictionary (collinsdictionary.com)
    -- Oxford Learner's Dictionaries (oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com)
    -- Cambridge Dictionary (dictionary.cambridge.org)

In addition to the above, various online sources and publications are regularly 
sampled to keep the dictionary relevant and up-to-date.

Inclusion Rules
----------------

This dictionary contains words conforming to the preferred standard of 
British-English spelling.

    -- "-ise" is preferred over "-ize", "-sation" over "-zation", etc.
    -- US-English spelling is not allowed (e.g. "color", "odor", etc.)
    -- Some (few) universally-recognised words are allowed and included:
       Words like "movie", "bike", "soccer", "vacation", et al.
    -- Common proper names are included; not just common British / English 
       names but also common names from around the world.
    -- English borrows some words from French and other languages and therefore 
       inherits the associated diacritical marks. A limited number of the such 
       words with diacritics are included, for example, "blasé", "café", 
       "cliché", "coup d'état", "déjà vu", "crème brûlée", "crème fraiche". 
       However, the non-diacritical form should also be included; for example, 
       "blase", "cafe", "cliche", "coup d'etat", "deja vu", "creme brulee", 
       "creme fraiche".
