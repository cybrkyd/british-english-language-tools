# How to contribute

Thank you for stopping by and reading. Any and all help is most welcome. Please 
feel free to get involved in helping to build and improve these British-English 
language tools.

If you spot a word that should not be there, please report a bug:

* [Report an issue](https://github.com/darmeth/british-english-language-tools/issues)

## Submitting changes

Please send a 
[GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/darmeth/british-english-language-tools/pulls) 
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about 
[pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine 
for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit.
    > 
    > A short paragraph describing what has changed."
