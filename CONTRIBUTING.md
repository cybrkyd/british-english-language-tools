# How to contribute

feel free to get involved in helping to build and improve these British-English 
language tools.

If you spot a word that should not be there, please report a bug:

* [Report an issue](https://github.com/darmeth/british-english-language-tools/issues)

## Submitting changes

Please send a 
[GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/darmeth/british-english-language-tools/pulls) 
with a clear list of what you've done (read more about 
[pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine
